# AGENT.md Configuration

An `AGENT.md` file in your workspace gives Amp information about your project's codebase structure, development practices, and coding standards. Amp offers generate an `AGENT.md` for you if none exists.

*Planned: Support for scoped `AGENT.md` files in subdirectories and other more granular agent guidance.*
