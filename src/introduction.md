# Introduction

**Congratulations** on installing Amp. This manual helps you get the most out of it.

## What is Amp?

Amp is an agentic coding tool built by [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com). It runs in [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.amp) (and compatible forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and as a [command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourcegraph/amp). It's also multiplayer — you can share threads and collaborate with your team.

## Principles

1. Amp is unconstrained in token usage (and therefore cost). Our sole incentive is to make it valuable, not to match the cost of a subscription.
2. No model selector, always the best models. You don't pick models, we do. Instead of offering selectors and checkboxes and building for the lowest common denominator, Amp is built to use the full capabilities of the best models.
3. We assume that you want to access the raw power these models have to offer. In a sense, when you're using Amp, you aren't using Amp — you're talking directly to a model and Amp is the shell around your conversation with the model.
4. Built to change. Products that are overfit on the capabilities of today's models will be obsolete in a matter of months.
