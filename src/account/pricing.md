# Pricing

## Usage

Upon signing up, most users get $10 USD in free usage. You can purchase more as an individual or for your team. Unused credits expire after one year of account inactivity.

Usage is consumed based on LLM usage and usage of certain other tools (like web search) that cost us to serve. We pass these costs through to you directly with no markup, for individuals and non-enterprise teams.

## Enterprise

Enterprise usage is 50% more expensive than individual and team usage, and includes SSO (Okta, SAML, etc.) and zero data retention for text inputs in LLM inference. See Amp Security Reference for more information.

To start using Amp Enterprise, go to your team and click "Change Plan" in the top right corner. This requires a special one-time $1,000 USD purchase, which grants your team $1,000 USD of Amp Enterprise usage and upgrades your team to Enterprise.

With Amp Enterprise Premium, invoice payments are offered for purchases of $5,000+ USD, and volume discounts are available for purchases of $25,000+ USD. Contact amp-devs@sourcegraph.com for access to these purchasing options and for general information about Amp Enterprise.
