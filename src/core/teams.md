# Teams

Teams provide collaborative workspaces where knowledge can be shared across your organization. Create a team from the [settings page](https://ampcode.com/settings). To join a team, you need an invitation from an existing team member.

## Sharing

Team threads are visible to all team members by default, making it easy to learn from others and build on their work.

## Team Usage

Teams provide pooled billing of usage, making it easier to manage costs across your organization. If a member of your team joins with free personal usage available, their free usage will be used before the paid team usage.

## Leaderboard

Each team includes a leaderboard that tracks thread activity and contributions from team members, encouraging engagement and highlighting active participants.
